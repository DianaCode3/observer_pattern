# observer_pattern

Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

In this example we want decoupled code for a Player that Jumps, so we made a component for every aspect of the 'Jump' feature: PlayerAnimation, PlayerPhysics and AudioManager. To keep this simple, those components just have an method called 'Jump' to print a message on the console. To Invoke all those methods when the user pess the Space bar key we need to achieve two things:

1. Subscribe those methods to an event, in this case we have the 'OnPlayerJump' event, wish is a member of the component EventManager.

2. Invoke that event when the Space bar key is pressed, we do this since the component InputManager calling a method inside the EventManager which Invoke the 'OnPlayerJump' event.
